# clean-modules üßπ

> Clean up/prune unnecessary files and reduce the size of your `node_modules` directory. Useful for
> CI caches or for reducing the size of your AWS Lambdas/Azure Functions.

Look, it's yet another `node_modules` cleaning tool! There are lots of these around, but I still
found the need to write my own. See the [Alternatives](#alternatives) section for more details.

This CLI tool combines combines all features that I could not find in other tools:

- üßπ Removes directories and files that are unnecessary and **safe to remove in production**
- üõ† Easily customisable through glob patterns
- üìÅ Cleans up empty directories after removing files
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Super fast, but still written in Node
- üîç Allows analyzing results, like which pattern excluded which file

## Installation

`clean-modules` can be installed globally if you only want to use it as a CLI tool:

```bash
# npm
npm install -g clean-modules

# yarn
yarn global add clean-modules
```

## Usage

Simply run the command in the directory where your `node_modules` are:

```bash
clean-modules
```

You can also pass a path to where your `node_modules` are located as a positional argument:

```bash
clean-modules path/to/my/node_modules
```

If you want to include/exclude certain globs, skip the confirmation box or try running it without
actually removing any files - check out the [options](#options)!

## Options

### `--include | -i`

`string` (default: `undefined`)

Accepts a glob string of files/folders to include that are not included by default. Can be added
multiple times.

See the [globs](#globs) section for info on how the globs are parsed and which globs are included by
default.

**Example**:

```bash
# includes all TypeScript declaration files and @types folders
clean-modules --include "**/*.d.ts" --include "**/@types/**"
```

### `--exclude | -e`

`string` (default: `undefined`)

Accepts a glob string of files/folders to exclude from the list of included files. Excludes files
included by both `--include` option and by default. Can be added multiple times.

See the [globs](#globs) section for info on how the globs are parsed and which globs are included by
default.

**Example**:

```bash
# excludes all sourcemap files and PNG files
clean-modules --exclude "**/*.map.js" --exclude "**/*.png"
```

### `--analyze | -a`

`analyze` (default: `false`)

Prints info of all globs used, which files were removed or excluded, and which globs they were
included by.

### `--keep-empty | -k`

`boolean` (default: `false`)

Skips removing empty folders after removing files.

### `--dry-run | -d`

`boolean` (default: `false`)

Runs the script and prints the same information, but doesn't actually remove any files.

### `--yes | -y`

`boolean` (default: `false`)

Skips the confirmation prompt at the start of the script.

### `--json | -j`

`boolean` (default: `false`)

Only logs a final JSON dump at the end of the script, useful for logs or services.

### `--version | -v`

Prints the installed version of `clean-modules`.

### `--help | -h`

Prints the help documentation.

## Globs

`clean-modules` uses [`picomatch`](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch) with the following options
for all glob matching:

```js
{
  dot: true,
  nocase: true
}
```

This means that it will not ignore dotfiles, and does not care about casing of filenames or
directories. Globs are matched with the **full file paths**, not just the file names, so if you just
want to include a specific file make sure to prefix it with globstars (like `**/fileToInclude.js`).

### Recommended inclusions

- `**/*.d.ts`: **If you don't use TypeScript.** TypeScript declaration files take up a lot of space
  in your `node_modules` folder, but they are most likely required to build your application. Useful
  locally even if you don't use TypeScript since they can be parsed by your IDE.

### Recommended exclusions

- `**/*.map.js`: **If you are running `clean-modules` locally or need source files in production.**
  `clean-modules` removes sourcemap files by default since they take up a lot of space and does not
  break builds when removed. They can be nice to have though, especially while developing.

## Alternatives

The most common issues I found with available tools are:

- They only allow inclusion/exclusion of file names, not file paths. This prevents you from e.g.
  excluding subdirectories of a specific folder, like `@types/react-native`.
- They include too many, or too few, patterns by default. Lots of them also include patterns like
  `*.ts` by default, which breaks TypeScript declaration files on build.
- They are too slow (only relevant when running on large projects)
- They are abandoned or don't respond to issues.
